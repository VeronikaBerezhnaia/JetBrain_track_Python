Here are my exercises in Python, which I study on my own from online platforms.
Huffington decoding and encoding algorithms come from the online IT education platform Stepik, site stepik.org.
Projects of Coffee Machine and of Matrix Calculator are from the online IT education platform JetBrains Academy, site hyperskills.org, as a part of Python Developer study track.

All the projects loaded here have successfully passed the autotesting integrated in the platforms.

Also I study on online self-education plateform stepik.org. There I have taken the cours "Algorithms, theory, parcatice, methods", which is now in progress (on 29 April 2021).
